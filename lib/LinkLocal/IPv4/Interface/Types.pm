=head1 NAME

LinkLocal::IPv4::Interface::Types - A collection of shared Moose type definitions and coercions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use LinkLocal::IPv4::Interface::Types;

  has 'ip_address' => (
      is  => 'ro',
      isa => 'IpAddress',
  );

  has 'packet' => (
      is  => 'ro',
      isa => 'ArpPacket',
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Moose-based wrapper object provides a collection of shared types compliant with and dependant
upon the Moose type and constraint system. All type coercions are also present here. Client code 
only need 'use' this file and it has access to all custom types in a system wide fashion.

=head1 SUBTYPES

=over 4

=item B<ArpPacket> 
 From base type Object, isa L<Net::Frame::Layer::ARP>. ArpPacket provides the basis for both
 ARP Probes and Announce messages, both of which are required in the implementation of
 RFC-3927.

=item LinkLocalInterface
 From base type Object, isa L<IO::Interface::Simple>. LinkLocalInterface is a custom object
 wrapper of a hardware network interface on the system being configured for dynamic link-local
 addressing. It provides an entry point to this auto-ip framework.

=item B<IpAddress>
 From base type Str, uses L<Regexp::Common> to provide a type constraint for IPv4 dotted-decimal 
 notation addresses.

=item B<LinkLocalAddress>
 From base type IpAddress, this type provides for a type constraint for IPv4 dotted-decimal
 notation addresses as is specified in RFC-3927; The prefix 169.254/16 is reserved by IANA for
 the exclusive use of link-local address allocation (noting that the first 256 and last 256 
 addresses in the 169.254/16 prefix are reserved for future use and MUST NOT be selected by 
 a host using this dynamic configuration mechanism).

=head1 COERCIONS

=over 4

=item B<ArpPacket>
Type coercion of a Moose HashRef into an ArpPacket type via a L<Net::Frame::Layer::ARP>
object type.

=item B<LinkLocalInterface>
Type coercion of a Moose Str type representing a network device name into an object of
type L<IO::Interface::Simple>.

text of which can be found in the top level of the package archive.
