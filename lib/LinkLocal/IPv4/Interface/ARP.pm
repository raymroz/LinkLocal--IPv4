=head1 NAME

LinkLocal::IPv4::Interface::ARP - An ARP packet wrapper, representing one of two ARP packets
required by the specification, type PROBE or ANNOUNCE.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use LinkLocal::IPv4::Interface::ARP;

  $arp = LinkLocal::IPv4::Interface::ARP->new();

  # Initialize a hash reference for each type of ARP message required.
  my $set_probe    = { srcIp => '000.000.000.000', dstIp => '169.254.100.100' };
  my $set_announce = { srcIp => '169.254.100.100', dstIp => '169.254.100.100' };

  # Setup an ARP PROBE packet, testing if link-local address 169.254.100.100 is in use
  $arp->packet( $set_probe );

  # Setup an ARP ANNOUNCE packet, claiming link-local address 169.254.100.100 on network
  $arp->packet( $set_announce );
  
  # Also valid, if no srcIp hash key, assumes probe and zeroes sender address
  my $set_probe    = { dstIp => '169.254.100.100' };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This small ARP packet wrapper class plays a critical role in the dynamic configuration of IPv4
link-local addresses. When a new address is pseudo-randomly determined, ARP PROBE messages are
sent out over the interface which is being configured. The ARP packets are of type request,
have the source address zeroed out and the target address (dstIp) set to the address which has
been selected and is being probed. Three of these ARP PROBEs are sent at randomly spaced 
intervals and if no conflict is detected during the process, the implementation will claim the
address for the interface within the unmanaged network.

After an address has been claimed, the implementation requires that three ARP ANNOUNCE packets 
be broadcast on the network. These packets have both sender and target addresses set to the 
address which has been claimed by the implementation and the purpose here is to make sure that
there are no stale ARP cache entries anywhere on the local link.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item B<packet>
This attributes hold the custom Moose type ArpPacket which in essence provides and allows for
the Moose class wrapper around the L<Net::Frame::Layer::ARP> object type. The packet attribute
exposes a number of mappings via the Moose attribute handler construct which allow for direct
mapping between them and the object reference type without forcing the additional layer of
indirection upon client code.

=item B<raw>
This attribute is inherited from the original L<Net::Frame::Layer> class and it holds the raw
layer as has just been pulled from the network or has been packed for network transmission (see 
the dump_arp() method below).

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<packet()>
The packet() method provides the most basic means of setting the target and sender addresses
to the desired value, depending upon the type of ARP packet being constructed. packet() takes
both a blessed or non-blessed hash reference, so the return type from object creation can be
passed to this method as long as this blessed reference isa L<Net::Frame::Layer::ARP> object.

=item B<pack_arp()>
Packs all attributes into a raw format suitable for injection into the network. Returns the 
raw packed string on success, undef otherwise. Result is stored into raw attribute. See 
L<Net::Frame::Layer> for further details.

=item B<unpack_arp()>
Unpacks raw data from network and stores attributes into the object. Returns $this on success, 
undef otherwise.

=item B<get_key()>

=item B<get_key_reverse()>
These two methods are basically used to increase speed when using the recv method from 
L<Net::Frame::Simple> via the packet object attribute. Usually, you use them when you need 
to write a match method.

=item B<is_match()>
This method is mostly used internally. You pass a L<LinkLocal::IPv4::Interface::ARP->packet> 
attribute as a parameter, and it returns true if this is a response corresponds with the 
request, otherwise false.

=item B<print_arp()>
Prints a human readable string representation of the packet and its underlying state.

=item B<dump_arp()>
Prints a hexadecimal formatted respresentation of the packet, exactly how this would appear on
the network.

=back

Please Note: While this class does not directly override or map all of the underlying attributes
and methods which are present in the base L<Net::Frame::Layer> type from which the Moose
class is derived, one could, with an extra level of indirection, access the underlying
attributes and methods from that base type. Please see the relevant POD for further details.
